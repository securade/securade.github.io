            <div class="section-content">
                <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Creating a vision AI application for danger zone detection involves several key steps. This section will walk you through the process, from data collection to deployment.</p>

<ol class="fs-5 mb-4" style="list-style: decimal inside;">
    <li><strong>Data Collection and Annotation:</strong> Gather a diverse dataset of images and videos that represent various scenarios within the danger zones. This data should include examples of people both inside and outside the designated areas, as well as different lighting conditions and environmental factors. Annotate the data by labeling the regions of interest (i.e., the danger zones and the people).</li>
    <li><strong>Model Selection:</strong> Choose an appropriate computer vision model for object detection. Popular choices include YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot Detector), and Faster R-CNN. Consider factors such as accuracy, speed, and computational requirements when selecting a model.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Train the selected model using the annotated dataset. This process involves feeding the data into the model and adjusting its parameters to improve its ability to accurately detect people in danger zones. Consider using techniques such as transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models and reduce training time.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> Evaluate the performance of the trained model using a separate validation dataset. Assess metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the model's accuracy and reliability. Fine-tune the model as needed to optimize its performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Deploy the trained model to a suitable platform for real-time processing. This could involve deploying the model on edge devices (e.g., cameras with onboard processing) or on a cloud-based server. Ensure that the deployment environment meets the computational and latency requirements of the application.</li>
</ol>

										<li><strong>Delayed Response</strong>: Reactive methods often mean that safety issues are only addressed after an incident has occurred. This delay can lead to increased risks, including the potential for repeat incidents and greater harm.</li>
										<li><strong>Human Error</strong>: Manual inspections and paper-based reporting are prone to human error. Overlooked details, misinterpretation of data, and simple forgetfulness can lead to significant safety oversights.</li>
										<li><strong>Limited Scope</strong>: Traditional safety measures may not comprehensively cover all potential hazards, especially in complex and dynamic environments like construction sites. This can leave critical safety gaps unaddressed.</li>
										<li><strong>Cost Inefficiency</strong>: The aftermath of incidents often involves costly investigations, downtime, and potential legal ramifications, all of which could be mitigated with more proactive measures.</li>
										<li><strong>Worker Morale</strong>: A reactive approach can affect worker confidence in safety protocols, as it may seem that measures are only taken after something goes wrong, rather than preventing hazards.</li>
									</ol>
									<p class="fs-5 mb-4">
										Despite these challenges, the advent of AI video analytics offers a promising solution. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, it is possible to overcome many of these limitations, shifting the focus from merely responding to incidents to actively preventing them.
